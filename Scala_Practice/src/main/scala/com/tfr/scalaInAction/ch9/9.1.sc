//What is Concurrent Programming
//when more than one task can start and complete in overlapping time periods

//cpu usage unpredictable

//parallel programming = run multiple tasks at the same time, possible with multiple processors

//state sharing can cause threads to wait for state from each other, and then your program is no longer parallel

//distributed computing - multiple computing nodes distributed across the network, working together on a given problem
